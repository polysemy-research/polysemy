import Polysemy

-- | @Scoped@ transforms a program so that @effect@ is associated with a
-- @resource@ within that program. This requires the interpreter for @effect@ to
-- be parameterized by @resource@ and constructed for every program using
-- @Scoped@ separately.
--
-- An application for this is @Polysemy.Conc.Events@ from
-- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-conc>, in which each program
-- using the effect @Polysemy.Conc.Consume@ is interpreted with its own copy of
-- the event channel; or a database transaction, in which a transaction handle
-- is created for the wrapped program and passed to the interpreter for the
-- database effect.
--
-- For a longer exposition, see <https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-01-05-polysemy-scoped/>.
--
-- Resource allocation is performed by a function passed to
-- 'Polysemy.Scoped.interpretScoped'.
--
-- The constructors are not intended to be used directly; the smart constructor
-- 'scoped' is used like a local interpreter for @effect@. 'scoped' takes an
-- argument of type @param@, which will be passed through to the interpreter, to
-- be used by the resource allocation function.
--
-- As an example, imagine an effect for writing lines to a file:
--
-- > data Write :: Effect where
-- >   Write :: Text -> Write m ()
-- > makeSem ''Write
--
-- If we now have the following requirements:
--
-- 1. The file should be opened and closed right before and after the part of
--    the program in which we write lines
-- 2. The file name should be specifiable at the point in the program where
--    writing begins
-- 3. We don't want to commit to IO, lines should be stored in memory when
--    running tests
--
-- Then we can take advantage of 'Scoped' to write this program:
--
-- > prog :: Member (Scoped FilePath resource Write) r => Sem r ()
-- > prog = do
-- >   scoped "file1.txt" do
-- >     write "line 1"
-- >     write "line 2"
-- >   scoped "file2.txt" do
-- >     write "line 1"
-- >     write "line 2"
--
-- Here 'scoped' creates a prompt for an interpreter to start allocating a
-- resource for @"file1.txt"@ and handling @Write@ actions using that resource.
-- When the 'scoped' block ends, the resource should be freed.
--
-- The interpreter may look like this:
--
-- > interpretWriteFile :: Members '[Resource, Embed IO] => InterpreterFor (Scoped FilePath Handle Write) r
-- > interpretWriteFile =
-- >   interpretScoped allocator handler
-- >   where
-- >     allocator name use = bracket (openFile name WriteMode) hClose use
-- >     handler fileHandle (Write line) = embed (Text.hPutStrLn fileHandle line)
--
-- Essentially, the @bracket@ is executed at the point where @scoped@ was
-- called, wrapping the following block. When the second @scoped@ is executed,
-- another call to @bracket@ is performed.
--
-- The effect of this is that the operation that uses @Embed IO@ was moved from
-- the call site to the interpreter, while the interpreter may be executed at
-- the outermost layer of the app.
--
-- This makes it possible to use a pure interpreter for testing:
--
-- > interpretWriteOutput :: Member (Output (FilePath, Text)) r => InterpreterFor (Scoped FilePath FilePath Write) r
-- > interpretWriteOutput =
-- >   interpretScoped (\ name use -> use name) \ name -> \case
-- >     Write line -> output (name, line)
--
-- Here we simply pass the name to the interpreter in the resource allocation
-- function. Note how the type of the effect changed, with the @resource@
-- parameter being instantiated as @FilePath@ instead of @Handle@.
-- This change does not need to be anticipated in the business logic that uses
-- the scoped effect – as is visible in the signature of @prog@, the @resource@
-- parameter is always chosen concretely by an interpreter.
--
-- Now imagine that we drop requirement 2 from the initial list – we still want
-- the file to be opened and closed as late/early as possible, but the file name
-- is globally fixed. For this case, the @param@ type is unused, and the API
-- provides some convenience aliases to make your code more concise:
--
-- > prog :: Member (Scoped_ resource Write) r => Sem r ()
-- > prog = do
-- >   scoped_ do
-- >     write "line 1"
-- >     write "line 2"
-- >   scoped_ do
-- >     write "line 1"
-- >     write "line 2"
--
-- The type 'Scoped_' and the constructor 'scoped_' simply fix @param@ to @()@.
