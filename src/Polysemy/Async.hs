-- | Run an 'Async' effect in terms of 'A.async' through final 'IO'.
--
-- /Beware/: Effects that aren't interpreted in terms of 'IO'
-- will have local state semantics in regards to 'Async' effects
-- interpreted this way. See 'Final'.
--
-- Notably, unlike 'asyncToIO', this is not consistent with
-- 'Polysemy.State.State' unless 'Polysemy.State.runStateIORef' is used.
-- State that seems like it should be threaded globally throughout 'Async'
-- /will not be./
--
-- Use 'asyncToIO' instead if you need to run
-- pure, stateful interpreters after the interpreter for 'Async'.
-- (Pure interpreters are interpreters that aren't expressed in terms of
-- another effect or monad; for example, 'Polysemy.State.runState'.)
